# Out of the Attic Antiques Site Design

>Thank you for helping me with this site.  The point of this file is to help developers understand the processes behind the site.

## HTML
The site utilizes basic HTML language and includes HTML code for each page of the site.  There are also static HTML pages for the expanded pages once the links on the blog and events pages are clicked.

## SASS
This site also uses SASS via multiple SCSS files.  The files are organized into folders that contain their appropriate SCSS files.  The files are all combined into a single styles.css **CSS** file.

- The site utilizes _Prepos_ to render the SASS files into the single CSS file.

## JS
The site uses the following Javascript files:

1. Jquery
2. Dropzone for the drop box on the appraisals page.
3. Grt-youtube-popup to control the full screen _YouTube_ video.
4. Styles.js to concatenate files using _Prepos_.
